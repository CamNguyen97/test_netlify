I was fortunate to meet and work closely with Edwin on a 90m newbuild over a period of about 2 years. His deep knowledge and insights into AV, IT and lighting systems were crucial to the project. Edwin has excellent interpersonal skills and it was great to have someone who was able to mediate between all the various parties involved. I would recommend his services without hesitation.
