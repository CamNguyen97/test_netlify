"Over the last 2 decades I’ve had the privilege of working closely with some of the world’s most talented AV and IT engineers and their project managers. One of the very best is Edwin Edelenbos; his communication prowess coupled with an immediate and clinically accurate interpretation of a client’s expectations and preferences stand out."

- Glenn Dalby, Captain & Project Manager



“I have known Edwin since my Oceanco years. When I first met him he was working for a subcontractor on a project we had at the yard. I remember that we all, Oceanco’s staff, Owner’s Rep and the Owner himself were really astonished by his technical knowledge, as well as his ability to explain easily to us non-experts, these hi-tech concepts. He was very client oriented, and made the design process a very enjoyable one. It is so rewarding, and rare, to feel that you can fully trust somebody, that your project is definitely in the right hands. Not long after that project, Edwin was signed by Oceanco. I remember the talk when that became known... we had signed the “Cristiano Ronaldo” of AV/IT! Over the years I have had the opportunity of working with him on various projects, and getting to know him even better. I can confirm that not only is he an exceptional professional, but that he is also a great human being. That combination is definitely not common. I very much look forward to working with him on many more projects in the future”.

- Carlos Morales, Director General / General Manager, Astilleros de Mallorca



"I've known Edwin for 5 years now. His experience in AV/IT is outstanding! What I really admire is that he is not only an easy guy to connect with, but that he also has the ability to explain difficult things in a simple and trustworthy way. He always comes up with a solution!"

- Peter Aarts, Director of Operations, SuperYacht Times



"I was fortunate to meet and work closely with Edwin on a 90m newbuild over a period of about 2 years. His deep knowledge and insights into AV, IT and lighting systems were crucial to the project. Edwin has excellent interpersonal skills and it was great to have someone who was able to mediate between all the various parties involved. I would recommend his services without hesitation." 

- Tony Bøklepp, AV/IT Officer, private 90m yacht.



"During the specification phase we worked with Edwin to build up the AVIT, Events and Security systems. Edwin is very experienced and has a deep knowledge of how the systems are design and used. He covered everything in great detail with some excellent ideas, and he structured everything simply and efficiently, so once the spec was finalised we could work to contract suitable parties for the build."

- Owner's Representative, 110m+ new build



"I worked with Edwin during the build of project Y712 the 106m sailing yacht SY Black Pearl at Oceanco yacht builders in Alblasserdam. Edwin was always very informative in an unbiased way which was a nice change and made the project more illuminating. I enjoyed the discussions about future technologies and how they could be implemented, along with our chats on best practice for the installation of all equipment. Edwin is very knowledgeable about current and future technology and very passionate about his field of work. It would be a pleasure to work with Edwin on a project in the future."

- Derek Munro Director, Owner's Representative, Yacht Consultancy Ltd. UK



"Edwin was recommended to me in discussions regarding a feasibility study for an extensive refit to Yasmine of the Sea, 80mt project Y802, carried out during winter 2018-19. Edwin turned out to be the right person to act as independent consultant helping to review, modify and upgrade the proposals for a new AV and IT system on board. His comments and reports after survey visits were been very constructive and helpful, giving a good input to a successful project at full Owner satisfaction. I do really hope to have the occasion to enjoy his help and collaboration on future projects."

- Captain Lucio Prosperi, M.Y. Yasmine of the Sea



"I have worked with Edwin both at VBH and also when he has been involved as a consultant on a 80m+ yacht. His knowledge of the sector is second to none and his advice is invaluable on any yacht project. He is a pleasure to work with and I would recommend anyone looking for advice or consultation on a refit or new build project to use his services."

- Ian Grey, AV/IT Engineer 100m+ yacht



"I first worked with Edwin when he was a Technical manager at Oceanco and I was subcontracted to carry out programming through one of their partners. Edwin has a very deep technical understanding of the requirements for AVIT systems onboard yachts from his years at VBH & Oceanco. Not only is he able to engineer and design high reliability systems, he is not afraid to take on cutting edge technologies and integrate them into systems. Edwin is also someone who is passionate about raising technical standards within the industry and making sure owners have the systems onboard that will give them a reliable and enjoyable experience."

- Chris Horn, Crestron Programmer at Elixir Programming And Design UK, and ETO on multiple 80m+ yachts



"I have known Edwin for many years from the time we worked together and he was my go-to guy for all things technical and I’ve observed with pleasure and admiration his career progression. Edwin is not only extremely intelligent but he has a vast wealth of knowledge and experience and a very analytical and inquisitive mind with the ability to think outside of the box. This is the perfect combination to ensure that he remains up to date and even ahead of the curve in the fast moving industry in which he works. Edwin is an absolute pleasure to work with, polite, professional, efficient, incredibly organised and always positive and friendly with a wonderful mix of humbleness and self-depreciation. Whenever Edwin is involved in a project I have a deep sense of comfort knowing that all the technical aspects will be exactly as required and appropriate. But for me the most important aspects with Edwin are his honesty, transparency, ethics and his drive to deliver the best possible solution for his clients and I look forward to the next time we work together."
