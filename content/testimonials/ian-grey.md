I have worked with Edwin both at VBH and also when he was involved as a consultant on a 80m+ yacht. His knowledge of the sector is second to none and his advice is invaluable on any yacht project. He is a pleasure to work with and I would recommend anyone looking for advice or consultation on a refit or new build project to use his services.
