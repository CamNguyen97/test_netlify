Edwin was part of the Oceanco yard team on our new build project, and played a crucial role in the design and project management of the AV, IT and lighting systems. During the build he became a truly trusted advisor to myself and my team, and he continues to support us to this day. He has an excellent ability to understand and interpret requirements, and to discuss and present the resulting solutions in a way that is clear to everyone involved. He is honest, transparent and a pleasure to work with. Anyone looking for expert guidance in AV/IT and related systems would do well to seek Edwin out.
