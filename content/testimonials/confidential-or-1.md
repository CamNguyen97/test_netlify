During the specification phase we worked with Edwin to build up the AVIT, Events and Security systems. Edwin is very experienced and has a deep knowledge of how the systems are design and used. He covered everything in great detail with some excellent ideas, and he structured everything simply and efficiently, so once the spec was finalised we could work to contract suitable parties for the build.
