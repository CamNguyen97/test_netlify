I first worked with Edwin when he was a Technical manager at Oceanco and I was subcontracted to carry out programming through one of their partners. Edwin has a very deep technical understanding of the requirements for AVIT systems onboard yachts from his years at VBH & Oceanco. Not only is he able to engineer and design high reliability systems, he is not afraid to take on cutting edge technologies and integrate them into systems. Edwin is also someone who is passionate about raising technical standards within the industry and making sure owners have the systems onboard that will give them a reliable and enjoyable experience.
