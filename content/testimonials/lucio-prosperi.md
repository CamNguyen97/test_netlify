Edwin was recommended to me in discussions regarding a feasibility study for an extensive refit to Yasmine of the Sea, carried out during winter 2018-19. Edwin turned out to be the right person to act as independent consultant helping to review, modify and upgrade the proposals for a new AV and IT system on board. His comments and reports after survey visits were been very constructive and helpful, giving a good input to a successful project at full Owner satisfaction. I do really hope to have the occasion to enjoy his help and collaboration on future projects.
