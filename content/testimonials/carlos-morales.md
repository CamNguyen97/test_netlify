I have known Edwin since my Oceanco years. When I first met him he was working for a subcontractor on a project we had at the yard. I remember that we all, Oceanco’s staff, Owner’s Rep and the Owner himself were really astonished by his technical knowledge, as well as his ability to explain easily to us non-experts, these hi-tech concepts. He was very client oriented, and made the design process a very enjoyable one. It is so rewarding, and rare, to feel that you can fully trust somebody, that your project is definitely in the right hands. Not long after that project, Edwin was signed by Oceanco. I remember the talk when that became known... we had signed the “Cristiano Ronaldo” of AV/IT! Over the years I have had the opportunity of working with him on various projects, and getting to know him even better. I can confirm that not only is he an exceptional professional, but that he is also a great human being. That combination is definitely not common. I very much look forward to working with him on many more projects in the future.
