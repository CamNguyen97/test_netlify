I have known Edwin for many years from the time we worked together and he was my go-to guy for all things technical and Iâ€™ve observed with pleasure and admiration his career progression. Edwin is not only extremely intelligent but he has a vast wealth of knowledge and experience and a very analytical and inquisitive mind with the ability to think outside of the box. This is the perfect combination to ensure that he remains up to date and even ahead of the curve in the fast moving industry in which he works. Edwin is an absolute pleasure to work with, polite, professional, efficient, incredibly organised and always positive and friendly with a wonderful mix of humbleness and self-depreciation. Whenever Edwin is involved in a project I have a deep sense of comfort knowing that all the technical aspects will be exactly as required and appropriate. But for me the most important aspects with Edwin are his honesty, transparency, ethics and his drive to deliver the best possible solution for his clients and I look forward to the next time we work together.
