I worked with Edwin during the build of project Y712 the 106m sailing yacht SY Black Pearl at Oceanco yacht builders in Alblasserdam. Edwin was always very informative in an unbiased way which was a nice change and made the project more illuminating. I enjoyed the discussions about future technologies and how they could be implemented, along with our chats on best practice for the installation of all equipment. Edwin is very knowledgeable about current and future technology and very passionate about his field of work. It would be a pleasure to work with Edwin on a project in the future.
